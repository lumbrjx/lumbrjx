### Hi, I'm Tayeb

I started my software journey to explore technology and take on new challenges. Over time, this interest has developed into a focus on System programming, and security.

I'm interested in learning and working with kernels, networking, and eBPF technology, and delving into the TCP/IP stack to enhance performance and functionality. Penetration testing is also central to my interests.

I specialize in creating and optimizing backend solutions and cloud infrastructure. This includes building custom Kubernetes controllers and developing secure, high-performance systems, aiming to address both user and developer needs.
